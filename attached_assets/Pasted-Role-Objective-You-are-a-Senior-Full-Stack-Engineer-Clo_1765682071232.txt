Role & Objective

You are a Senior Full-Stack Engineer & Cloud Architect.

Your task is to design, implement, and deliver a fully production-ready Tour Booking Web Application using the MERN stack, following industry best practices, with clean architecture, security, scalability, and easy cloud deployment.

The final output must be deployable, maintainable, and scalable — not a demo or prototype.

Project Overview
Project Name

Tour Booking Platform

Core Goal

Build a modern web application where:

Users can browse and book tours

Admins can manage tours, bookings, and users

The system is secure, scalable, and cloud-ready

Tech Stack (Mandatory)
Frontend

React.js (with Vite or Next.js if beneficial)

TypeScript (preferred)

Tailwind CSS

Axios or React Query

React Hook Form + Zod validation

Backend

Node.js

Express.js

TypeScript

RESTful API architecture

Database

MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)

Authentication & Security

JWT (access + refresh tokens)

bcrypt password hashing

Role-based access control (User / Admin)

Secure HTTP headers (Helmet)

Rate limiting

Input sanitisation

DevOps & Deployment

Docker & Docker Compose

Environment variables (.env)

CI/CD ready

Deployment-ready for:

AWS (EC2 / ECS)

Render / Railway

Vercel (frontend)

Nginx (reverse proxy)

PM2 for backend process management

System Architecture Requirements
